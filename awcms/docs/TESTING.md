# Testing Guide

## Overview

AWCMS uses a combination of linting, build verification, and manual testing to ensure code quality.

---

## Automated Checks

### Linting

```bash
# Check for linting issues
npm run lint

# Auto-fix linting issues
npm run lint:fix
```

ESLint configuration uses `eslint-config-react-app` with rules for:

- React hooks
- Unused variables
- Best practices

### Build Verification

```bash
# Verify production build succeeds
npm run build
```

A successful build ensures:

- No syntax errors
- All imports resolve
- No TypeScript errors (in type-checked files)

### Security Audit

```bash
# Check for vulnerabilities
npm audit

# Expected output
found 0 vulnerabilities ✓
```
