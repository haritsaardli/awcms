# Indonesia Compliance Guide

## 1. Overview

This document outlines how AWCMS supports compliance with Indonesian regulations, specifically **UU PDP (Personal Data Protection Law)** and **PP 71/2019 (Penyelenggaraan Sistem dan Transaksi Elektronik)**.

## 2. UU No. 27 Tahun 2022 (UU PDP)

### Key Principles

- **Data Minimization**: Collect only what is necessary.
- **Purpose Limitation**: Use data only for the stated purpose.
- **Security**: Protect data from unauthorized access.

### AWCMS Implementation

- **Consent**: Built-in visual page builder can be used to create consent forms.
- **Rights of Data Subjects**:
  - **Right to Access**: `UserProfile` allows users to view their data.
  - **Right to Delete**: `Soft Delete` mechanism supports "right to be forgotten" workflows (hard delete can be implemented by admin).
  - **Right to Correct**: Edit forms available for all user profiles.
- **Data Encrytion**: All data is encrypted at rest and in transit via Supabase.

## 3. PP 71/2019 (PSE)

### Requirements

- **Data Localization**: For public sector, data must be processed in Indonesia. For private, it can be offshore but must be accessible for law enforcement.
- **Reliability**: System uptime and failure recovery.

### Implementation

- **Hosting**: Supabase projects can be deployed in compliant regions (e.g., AWS Jakarta if Enterprise, or Singapore for general private sector compliance).
- **Audit Trails**: Non-repudiation is supported via the `audit_logs` system.
