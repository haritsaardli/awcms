# Scalability Guide

## Purpose
Outline scalability considerations for AWCMS deployments.

## Audience
- Operators planning growth
- Engineers optimizing performance

## Prerequisites
- `awcms/docs/03-features/PERFORMANCE.md`

## Core Concepts

- Horizontal scalability via stateless clients.
- Supabase handles database and auth scaling.
- Cloudflare Pages provides edge caching for public content.

## How It Works

- Public portal uses SSR with edge runtime.
- Admin panel remains a SPA and relies on Supabase APIs.

## Implementation Patterns

- Use pagination and server-side filtering.
- Avoid loading unscoped data across tenants.

## Security and Compliance Notes

- Tenant isolation must hold under scale.
